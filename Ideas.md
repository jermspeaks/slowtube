# Ideas

- Subscribed channels view -- import the subscribed channels and see latest videos PER channel
- Create lists of subscribers so I can group WHICH videos I want to see by my grouping
- Adding tags to channels so I can easily organize and filter by that
- Channels view - seeing what channels I've added to watch later
- Better filters and sort view, since it's starting to clutter terrible.
- Card and table view should be organized as different pages altogether. They serve different purposes.
- Video player - we should add video player capability.
- Descriptions should be capped at 3 lines, then a show more button.
- Export video information as markdown
- Export channel information as markdown
- Add favicon

## Questions

- Do we still need Google OAuth w/ YouTube capabilities?

## Bugs

- Channel filter not filtering by the channel names
