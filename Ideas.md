# Ideas

- [x] Date range filter for dashboard, stats, and group views
- [x] Pagination! Might be good to only show 100 items at a time?
- [x] Add a count of videos next to the channel in group view
- [ ] Subscribed channels view -- import the subscribed channels and see latest videos PER channel
- [ ] Create lists (segments) of subscribers so I can group WHICH videos I want to see by my grouping
- [ ] Adding tags to channels so I can easily organize and filter by that
- [ ] Channels view - seeing what channels I've added to watch later
- [ ] Channel details - fetch the latest channel information
- [ ] Card and table view should be organized as different pages altogether. They serve different purposes.
- [ ] Video player - we should add video player capability.
- [ ] Descriptions should be capped at 3 lines, then a show more button.
- [ ] Export video information as markdown
- [ ] Export channel information as markdown
- [ ] Add favicon
- [ ] import liked videos. Allow us to analyze them, see what channels are cool, etc.
- [ ] Add a download function per video so we can have a local copy to do playback
  - [ ] Add sponsorblock so we can skip past it

## Questions

- [ ] Do we still need Google OAuth w/ YouTube capabilities?

## Bugs

- [x] Better filters and sort view, since it's starting to clutter terrible. We should have a show more, so only show most prominent items on top. It should all be in a different background color.
- [x] Group view showing all again
- [ ] Channel filter not filtering by the channel names
- [ ] The "Filter with all, feed, inbox, and archive" need to now just be feed, inbox, and archive. No need to have "All" unless we are in group view.
- [ ] Settings should be moved to the rightmost side, not left at all.
- [ ] Migrate over to shadcn buttons everywhere
- [ ] Looks like the page is acting slow because it's loading a ton of videos at once. What other tactics to improve performance
